Odin Admin Dashboard

This is a project from the Intermediate HTML and CSS course in the JavaScript Path on The Odin Project
.
The goal of this project is to build an admin dashboard layout to practice and strengthen my skills with CSS Grid.

📝 Project Description

The dashboard is a static web page designed to look like a typical admin panel.
It includes:

A sidebar navigation menu.

A header section.

A main content area with project cards, announcements, and trending items.

The layout is structured entirely with CSS Grid, with some flexbox usage where appropriate.

🎯 Why I built this

I created this project as part of my practice with CSS Grid.
It helped me to:

Understand how to create complex, responsive layouts using Grid.

Combine multiple layout techniques (Grid + Flexbox).

Improve my HTML and CSS structuring for real-world UI designs.

This project was a great exercise to solidify my knowledge before moving on to more advanced front-end projects.
